ðŸš€ Build & Deploy Java Application Using Maven in Jenkins Pipeline

This project was created by me to demonstrate how to build and deploy a Java application using Maven in a Jenkins pipeline (CI/CD).


---

ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Automate the Java build lifecycle using Maven.

Generate artifacts (.jar file) from source code.

Automatically deploy the application after a successful build.

Showcase a complete CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.



---

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

Jenkins â€“ CI/CD automation server

Maven â€“ Java build and dependency management tool

Java (JDK 11/17) â€“ Application programming language

GitHub â€“ Source code repository

Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) â€“ Pipeline as Code

Tomcat / Docker / AWS EC2 â€“ Deployment options



---

ðŸ“‚ Detailed Workflow

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Source Code Management

Application source code is stored in GitHub.

Jenkins is connected to GitHub via Webhooks for automatic build triggers.


ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Jenkins Setup

Jenkins installed with required plugins (Git, Maven, Pipeline, Deploy to Container).

Configured Maven and JDK under Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.


ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Build Process

1. Checkout Stage â†’ Fetch source code from GitHub.


2. Build Stage â†’ Compile, test, and package using Maven.


3. Artifact Stage â†’ Store the .jar file in the target/ directory.


4. Archive Stage â†’ Save the artifact inside Jenkins for future deployments.



ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Deployment Process

After the artifact is built, it is automatically deployed:

Option 1: Deploy to Tomcat Server

Jenkins copies the generated .war or .jar file to Apache Tomcat.

The application becomes available on http://<server-ip>:8080/app-name.


Option 2: Deploy using Docker

Build a Docker image containing the Java application.

Push the image to Docker Hub.

Run the container on any server or cloud instance.


Option 3: Deploy on AWS EC2

Copy the JAR file to an EC2 instance.

Run the application with java -jar.

Expose it through a security group for external access.

ðŸ“Š Benefits of this Pipeline

Fully Automated CI/CD â€“ From code commit to deployment.

Reliability â€“ Ensures only successfully built code is deployed.

Flexibility â€“ Supports multiple deployment targets (Tomcat, Docker, AWS).

Scalable â€“ Can easily be extended with monitoring, notifications, and approvals.



---

âœ… Deliverables

Successfully built Java artifact (.jar file).

Automated deployment on Tomcat / Docker / AWS EC2.

Jenkins pipeline execution logs with build & deployment history.



---

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project was created by me to practice setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline for Java applications using Maven and Jenkins.
The pipeline covers everything from source code checkout â†’ build â†’ test â†’ package â†’ deploy.
